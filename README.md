### 💡 About the App
Homerooom is an all-in-one mobile app solution for online learning. This app is made to tackle the issues found during COVID-19, where schools have a hard time to adjust with the WFH (work from home) situation.

Senior teachers have a hard time adjusting to multiple online platforms (ex: Zoom, Classroom, Form, Google Drive, etc). Students, especially in primary school, have a hard time keeping track of assignments and video conference links from every subject teachers. Lastly, students tend to have a hard time to focus or being engaged in online class, due to the lack of physical presence and interactions.

Therefore, Homerooom is built for students and teachers to have one app to do video conference, remind deadlines and submit assignments.

Another approach to increase engagement is to make games related to the subject readily available in the platform. Teacher can select games made in the platform for students to play. Students can get high scores, play with friends, and can get badges for achieving in games, which can be used as bonus points for teacher to score.
